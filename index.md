I am a first year computer science PhD student studying natural language processing (NLP) at University of Washington.
I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. Yejin Choi and Prof. Hanna Hajishirzi.
My research interests are reasoning, knowledge representation, and generation.

Previously, I received B.S. in Computer Science from University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.
I used to work in Facebook's Natural Language Generation (NLG) team.

My name in Chinese characters is 刘嘉程
